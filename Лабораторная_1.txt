There are 106 images described like a CT. All from
Georgia. These images have 19 parameters with disease
descriptions, like a CT scan. Annotation parameters for
CXR are absent.
For example, in Fig. \ref{fig: Fig. 4}, patient ID 1534 has one
annotated image with a study modality CR (Computed
Radiography), but the actual description is as if it were
a CT (Computed Tomography).

 \textit{It was decided to exclude these images from the further
investigations} for the following reasons:
\begin {itemize} 
\itemsep =-2mm
\item their annotation is different than most other files,
meaning that these images cannot participate in
neural network training together with everyone else;
\item 106 files can participate in separate neural network
training, but there is more valuable data to explore;
\item it is unclear why these images are described differently, and until this is clarified, it is better to exclude
them from further study.

A. \textit{Lesion names to describe the lungs lobes}
\par\quad 
In the CXR image, the lungs are divided into six lobes
or sextants:
\begin {itemize} 
\itemsep=0mm
\item Upper Right Sextant
 \item Upper Left Sextant;
\item Middle Right Sextant;
\item  Middle Left Sextant;
 \item Lower Right Sextant;
 \item Lower Left Sextant.
\end {itemize} 

\par\quad Each sextant has twenty identical lesion names, which
can be found in the corresponding JSON files for each
CXR image:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
\itemsep=0mm

\item Small Cavities
\item Medium Cavities
\item Large Cavities
\item Is any Large cavity belong to a multi-sextant cavity?
\item Can Multiple cavities be seen?
\item Small Nodules
\item Medium Nodules
\item Large Nodules
\item Huge Nodules
\item Is any calcified or partially-calcified Nodule exists?
\item Is any non-calcified Nodule exists?
\item Is any clustered Nodule exists
\item Are multiple Nodules exist?
\item Low/ground glass Density (active fresh nodules)
\item Medium Density (stabilized fibrotic nodules)
\item High Density (calcified nodules, typically sequella)
\item Low/ground glass Density
\item Medium Density
\item High Density
\item Collapse
\end{enumerate}
The data displayed on the CASE BROWSER [2] and
TB DEPOT [3] websites and the tag names in JSON files
are slightly different, but a mutually unambiguous match
can be made even by a non-specialist. The only nonobvious correspondence is that the field "Infiltrate" on
the website should correspond to the tag "High Density"
in JSON files. This match between the "Infiltrate" field
and "High Density" tag was found by the method of
exceptions as the last possible match.
Mutually unambiguous correspondence between the
data on the websites and in JSON files is given in Tab. I
and Tab. III.
The sequential arrangement of the twenty lesions in
Tab. I is the same as on the CASE BROWSER [2]
website.
The number of non-empty lesions in the lung sextants
is listed in Tab. II.
For convenience and to save space, in Tab. II, the word
"Sextant" is omitted in table header. The total number of

text annotations is 546,364. For the right lung: 282,817.
For the left lung: 263,547.
The division of the lungs into sextants is made by a
radiologist according to the following rules.
For CXR:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep =0mm
    \item Upper sextants are above the lower edge of the aortic arch;
    \item Middle sextants are between the lower edge of the
aortic arch and the right inferior pulmonary vein);
\item Lower sextants are below the right inferior pulmonary vein.
\end{itemize}
For CT:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep =0mm
\item Upper sextants are above keel level;
 \item Middle sextants are between keel and right inferior
pulmonary vein;
\item Lower sextants are below right inferior pulmonary
vein.
\end{itemize}

Approximately, \textit{some reservations}, the lung may
be considered to be divided into three equal lobes
vertically and into two equal lobes horizontally. It was
decided to determine the boundaries of the sextants by
calculating the third part of the total area of the lungs.
With this choice of boundaries, the sizes of the sextants
will be approximately the same in area. In this case the
boundaries of the sextant are approximate and not related
to lung anatomy. The left lung is where the heart and left
arm are located. The right lung is where the right arm
is located.

 Tab. II shows that the highest number of lung diseases
was registered in the upper lung lobes and the lowest
number of lung diseases was registered in the lower lung
lobes. At the same time, on average, more diseases were
registered in the right lung than in the left lung.

 According to Radiopaedia "post-primary infections
have a strong predilection for the upper zones" [4].
Right versus left lesions asymmetry is not so obvious
as top versus bottom and depends on the type (class)
of the lesion. Statistical Atlas of Lung Lesions [5], [6],
which was made by our team, is still in research. The
difficulty in studying the statistical distribution of lesions
is that they are of different nature and different biological
substrates.

 \appendix{B. \textit{Analysis of sextant lesion names}}

\par\quad According to the CASE BROWSER [2] website 20
lesion names are divided on the four groups (classes):
"Cavity", "Nodules", "Infiltrate" and "Collapse" (see
Tab. I).
\par\quad Additional analysis of the sextant lesions list is shown
in Fig. 5.
\par\quad In Fig. 5, equally significant sections of text are
highlighted with the same color. The 20 parameters are
specially grouped in such a way that the same significant
values are next to each other. Here are the definitions for
these diseases.

\par\quad A \textit{lung cavity} or pulmonary cavity is an abnormal,
thick-walled, air-filled space within the lung. Cavities in
the lung can be caused by infections, cancer, autoimmune
conditions, trauma, congenital defects, or pulmonary
embolism. The most common cause of a single lung
cavity is \textit{lung} cancer. Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal
infections are common causes of lung cavities [7].

\par\quad According to the glossary of terms for chest imaging
proposed by the Fleischner Society, a lung nodule is
defined as an approximately rounded opacity more or
less well-defined measuring up to 3 cm in diameter [8].
Rounded lesions measuring more than 3 cm in diameter
are termed lung masses and should be considered indicative of lung cancer until histologically proven otherwise.
Lung mass approach differs from that of nodules [9].

\par\quad The density of the lung reflects the total mass of
fluid, air, and dry lung tissue per unit volume of the
lung. Lung density can be measured by evaluation of
attenuation of an electron beam with CT. This technique
has been shown to be sufficiently reliable and sensitive
to distinguish normal from abnormal lung water [10].

\par\quad A pulmonary infiltrate is a substance denser than air,
such as pus, blood, or protein, which lingers within
the parenchyma of the lungs. Pulmonary infiltrates are
associated with pneumonia, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis [11].

\par\quad A collapsed lung (pneumothorax) occurs when air
escapes from the lung. The air then fills the \textit{space} outside
of the lung between the lung and chest wall. This buildup
of air puts \textit{pressure} on the lung, so it cannot expand as
much as it normally does when you take a breath. The
medical name of this condition is pneumothorax [12].

\par\quad Four general categories (classes) of disease can be
distinguished from the definitions above:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
\itemsep=0mm
\item class "Cavity" in the presence of one or more
abnormal thick-walled spaces in the lung filled with
air (gas);
