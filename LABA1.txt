and software tools for building geological models of
soil layers, multi-layer reservoirs; the Generator of the
geological model of a deposit (GGMD) --- the integrated
software complex of the composer of digital geological
and geoelogical models.\par
 We note the main additions to the GeoBazaDannych,
including methodological aspects and software components implemented using artificial intelligence tools. At
the same time, in order to understand the stages of
development and the relationship of the components, we
will give examples of the use of updated components of
the complex and recall fragments of the results that were
discussed and published in the proceedings of OSTIS.\par
In recent years, the activity of using artificial intelligence tools in solving problems of geology and geoecology has been rapidly increasing. In particular, dozens
of articles are published every year on the algorithms
and methods of cluster analysis considered in this paper.
There are publications that provide solutions to practical
problems, methods of preprocessing and interpretation
of geophysical data, analysis of results, expert opinions
of conclusions and recommendations (for example, [5],
[6]).\par
A number of features of data preparation for computerbased geological and geoecological models from the perspective of the feasibility of using artificial intelligence
tools have been regularly discussed at OSTIS conferences
since 2019. We will note only the typical difficulties
that arise when developing tools and conducting computational experiments for specific practical tasks, which
were identified and solutions are presented in subsequent
results.\par
Thus, in the materials of the OSTIS-2019 conference
(``Examples of the use of artificial neural networks in
the analysis of geodata\textquotedbl ), methodological and technical
solutions, software tools, results and examples of data
processing typical for geophysical methods of studying
geological objects, in particular, on observation profiles,
were discussed and published. The effectiveness of the
use of artificial neural networks to eliminate noise and
errors in the measurement results, perform the necessary
data preprocessing for mathematical models by smoothing in order to prepare regular digital distributions is
illustrated.\par
In the materials of the OSTIS-2020 conference (“Examples of intelligent adaptation of digital fields by
means of the GeoBazaDannych system“ and ”Interactive
Adaptation of Digital Fields in the GeoBazaDannych
System\textquotedbl ), examples of interactive formation of digital
models of geological and geoecological objects in computational experiments that meet the intuitive requirements of an expert are considered and given. Methodological and algorithmic solutions effective in processing remote environmental monitoring data, special tools 
of the GeoBazaDannych system are noted, the results

of interactive adaptation and comparison with standard reference solutions in the complex \textquotedbl Generator of the geological model of the deposit are presented.\textquotedbl 

The examples show that this way you can significantly improve the quality and adequacy of the digital description. But you need to understand that at that stage of the state of the algorithmic and software complex of GeoBazaDannych, the allocation itself is implemented according to the intuitive suggestions of the expert.

The issues of automatic identification of sites of the “highlighted” type using cluster analysis tools integrated into the GeoBazaDannych system were discussed at the OSTIS-2022 conference; some positive results were published in the proceedings of the conference and in [7]. In particular, the results illustrating the effects of choosing and confirming the best clustering algorithms are presented, and the options for using different clustering methods are compared, moreover, for different ways of setting the metric distance. In the above-mentioned published materials of OSTIS-2022, along with the positive ones, the disadvantages of the described software implementations and the settings used were noted.

A number of additions to the GeoBazaDannych complex, other variations of the settings of the Wolfram Mathematica system tools for data clustering have been tested in calculations, visualized and described below. Nevertheless, it should be understood that further research, improvement of algorithms and modification of software tools are needed.

The results below cannot be strictly mathematically
justified, but are indicative and adequate due to the rules
of their preparation. On the one hand, they are being
formed by random number generators and refined by an
expert in order to give them the character of comparable
data from field observations in the practice of geophysical methods for studying geological, geoecological
objects On the other hand, accepted mathematical expressions are used for measurement values in observations
(in calculations, this is an imitation). In fact, for each
particular processing algorithm, it is known that the basic
(reference) digital distribution can be calculated with the
necessary accuracy — comparing calculations with the
standard, one can judge the advantages and disadvantages
of the method used. Below, the reference distribution (in
the accepted GeoBazaDannych terminology, the surface)
differs slightly from that considered in [4], the location of the fragments of disturbances and their shape
and dimensions have been changed for some. Generally
speaking, there was no need for changes, because the set
of fragments of typical relief elements in [4] was quite
representative, but calculations were performed specifically for a reference surface of a different shape to ensure

stable reproduction of the qualitative properties of the
results obtained. All the calculation variants described
below were performed for both reference distributions,
they confirmed that the results are qualitatively the same;
they do not change with variations in the size, position,
orientation of perturbations.  

The results presented in this paper are obtained using
the numerical values of the level marks of the (reference)
surface according to the formula (1):\\


\begin{spacing}{0.3}
\[ zSurfH(x, y) = fOriginF(x, y)+\]
\[+400 \cdot fHill6(0.005 \cdot (x - 250), 0.007 \cdot (y - 400))+\]
\[+600 \cdot· fHill3(0.01 \cdot (x - 150), 0.01 \cdot (y - 150))-\]
\[-200 \cdot fHill(0.01 \cdot (x - 880), 0.015 \cdot (y - 500))-\]
\[-150 \cdot fHill(0.02 \cdot (x - 920), 0.004 \cdot (y - 100))+\]
\[+200 \cdot fHill5(0.006 \cdot (x - 450), 0.001 \cdot (y - 150)),\]
\[fOriginF(x, y) = zBasicF(x).
\]

The visualization of the zSurfH reference surface is
shown in Figures 1 and 2, where 3D views are shown in
the surface and volume variants; Figure 2 shows a map
of isolines. Additionally, the numbers of fragments of
disturbances are added to the image on the contour map
(in parentheses in blue).
\par
The corresponding scheme of their placement is shown
in Figure 3, where the isolines of the reference surface
and the one reconstructed in Wolfram Mathematica are
also given (the Interpolation method, InterpolationOrder
= 1).\par
The initial data for demonstrating methods and algorithms of mining and clustering were obtained using a
random number generator, in which the following were
set: the number of observation profiles, points on each
profile, and coordinates of the beginning and end of
the profile were generated in the specified ranges of
values. The values in the points were calculated using
the formula (1) — simulation of measurements of the
level of the surface being restored. Note that in fact we
have a scattered set of points.

Cluster analysis allows for many different types of
clustering techniques/algorithms to determine the final
result [8], [9]. We note the development, a new way of
processing data, and present the results of the comparison Without going into the details of the algorithmic,
software implementation, we recall that in [7] clustering
was actually performed according to two parameters,
namely, grouping was carried out according to the criterion of proximity of points with measurements. In the
presented results, grouping is performed according to
a combination of three values, namely, for each point,
their coordinates (x,y) and the z value (surface level)
were taken into account. Here are several interpretations

The schemes in Figure 4 repeat the graphic layers from
the maps above, they are useful for interpretation and
explanation. The schema at the top details the reference,
clearly marked sections of fragments-perturbations. The
schema below clearly shows areas where there is no
reproduction of the standard, which is explained by
the lack of measurements. The contour map with data
points at the bottom is useful for understanding that in
some areas the field cannot be restored to the standard

because there are no measurements. It is clear that in
parts of the area where the digital field differs from
the reference, classification / binding to a fragment disturbance is unlikely\\

(rProfXYZ) at the bottom. The upper illustration shows
the results of calculations with the settings of the
KMeans method, as in [7]. Below is the current implementation for the same method; in both versions, the
metric is "default", the number of clusters is 6.

The proposed clustering method for three parameters
is clearly preferable to the method for two, in particular,
in terms of localization of fragments 1, 4 and 5. The

 results near fragments 2 and 3 are not indicative due
to the discontinuous distribution on different sides of
the horizontal dotted magenta line (projection onto the
horizontal plane of the fragment section-perturbation 3
by the vertical plane).

Such situations (gaps, offset) are not identified at all
in conventional digital field restoration systems without
special a priori additional conditions. Note that in the
GeoBazaDannych, such conditions can be set interactively by correcting the initial information on the map
[3].

The figure shows the results of the variant when
the number of clusters is set to 6. Why. Determining
the number of clusters is one of the most important
segmentation problems. In a broader sense, this is the
problem of initializing the algorithm. The results of the
variants for the number of clusters from 4 to 9 were
calculated and compared. According to the results of the
comparison, the variant of 6 clusters seems preferable,
and the explanation for this may probably be that the distribution is reproduced when there is a basic continuous
surface-a ribbon and 5 fragments-perturbations, i. e. 6
different shapes\\
